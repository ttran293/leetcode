#Given three ints, a b c, return True if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), 
#while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

  return (abs(a-b)<=1 and abs(a-c)>=2 and abs(b-c)>=2) or (abs(a-c)<=1 and abs(a-b)>=2 and abs(b-c)>=2)
